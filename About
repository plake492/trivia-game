Here I've made a "The Office" themed trivia games. You have -- seconds to answer all the questions. 
If the timer runs out, the game will end and tell you how many you git right and how many you got wrong.
When you submit your answer, It will play one of two scens from The Office, depenmding on if you git more than half, 
or less than half of the answers correct.

I was unable to make it reset as requested, but I did add a refresh function that refreshes the page on click (I know it says to not refresh the page, but I though it was better than nothing)
